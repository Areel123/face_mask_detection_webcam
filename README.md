For my fourth internship project, I focused on developing a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques. I began by downloading and exploring a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of images categorized into masked and non-masked classes. Utilizing Python libraries such as os, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and cv2, I performed data preprocessing, including resizing and normalization of images. I then employed TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the MobileNet architecture. The model was fine-tuned and trained for 15 epochs, achieving high accuracy on the validation set. After training, I evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and implemented a real-time mask detection system using OpenCV to capture and predict mask usage through a webcam. I have tested this system on my laptop webcam, successfully detecting face masks in real-time. The project demonstrated the integration of computer vision and deep learning for effective face mask detection.
